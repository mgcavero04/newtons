 
 Newtons and Secant Approximation:
 
 Run this file can be run from command promp(python installed) from its location with: python mnP1.py

 The program begins asking for initial required values.
 Then the call to the the Newton and Secant methods are saved in two variables: lambda2 and lambda1 respectively.
 Each function pass its own parameters as especified in the requirement
 Then both of those variables are called so each of the functions can run one after another.
 The derivative function is called and passed in another variable: 'f_prime' for the Newtons method
 each of the methods show each of the iterations before showing the convergence solution value.
